Description: 

This prototype presents a demo using ECS on Unity to create an asteroids belt.

The project includes a scene called "Asteroids." You can play the game as the pilot of a spaceship. Use the mouse to point your ship and WASPQE keys to move it.

The code to control the creation of the asteroid is on a Game Object called ECSManager. 

The focus of this demo is the creation of the Asteroids field using ECS and offering to other developers a reference to create their own games.
